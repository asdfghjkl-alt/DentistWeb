          <p>Edward Dental is <strong>completely about relationships, building relationships with you</strong>, our patient. We really spend most of our time trying to get to know you and what it is you are here for.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>We have your best interest at heart. We are not a corporate or part of an insurance company. We are a private practice: a husband and wife team with our fellow associates. We only answer to you not to a board of directors or the insurance companies.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>When you are a patient at our practice you become <strong>part of our family.</strong></p>
          <p></p>
          <p><strong>Some of our long term patients are dental-phobic, they return because our staff are understanding and reassuring we provide gentle dental care.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>At Rawson Dental we want to exceed your expectations.</strong> We transform teeth into happy healthy confident smiles and thereby <strong></strong>changing peopleâ€™s lives.</p>
